  <h3>Past Conquests</h3>
  <p>
    I am a strong competitor in all aspects of my life.
    Being orphaned at a young age, I learned the importance of fending for myself and keeping my independence.
    Alongside my hunky husband, Khal Drogo, I learned the correct balance of mercy and punishment.
    I work best alone, although I can be a team play too (assuming I am in a leadership role).
    I thrive under stressful situations and have a strong work ethic. My subjects would describe me as loyal and stubborn.
    Above all my accomplishments, that which I am most proud of is raising my three dragons.
